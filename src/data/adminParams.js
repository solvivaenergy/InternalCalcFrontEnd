// Default values match the v3.2 .xlsm:
//   Solviva_Calc_v_B_3_2.xlsm  (uploaded May 7, 2026)
//
// IMPORTANT — v3.2 Excel switch from supplier-cost markup to direct prices:
//
//   Earlier Excel versions (and this codebase up through v3-20) derived
//   resale prices from supplier costs via:
//     adminPrice = supplierCost × 0.70 / (1 − BASELINE_RATE)
//   where BASELINE_RATE = Admin!A1 = 0.26144542543429433.
//
//   In v3.2, the Excel Admin sheet column D now holds DIRECT-PURCHASE PRICES
//   (rounded PHP, e.g. ₱1,137 instead of markup(1200) ≈ ₱1,137.36). The
//   markup-divisor formula is no longer applied per cell. To keep the web
//   app's math identical to the Excel, every `markup(supplierCost)` call site
//   below has been replaced with the literal Excel D-column value.
//
//   The `markup()` helper and `BASELINE_RATE` are kept exported (and
//   re-exported by paramsService.js) for backward compatibility — but no
//   longer called inside this file. If a future Excel version reintroduces
//   the supplier-cost-then-markup pattern, the helper is still here.

// Multipliers applied to the SINGLE-PHASE cabling tier percentages to derive
// the default THREE-PHASE tier table. Engineering rationale:
//   • DC cabling  ×1.0 — panel-to-inverter string wiring is upstream of the
//     AC phase configuration; identical for a given array size.
//   • AC cabling  ×1.5 — 3 lines + neutral vs 2 conductors: heavier
//     multi-core cable and more terminations.
//   • Conduits    ×1.2 — larger conduit trade size + extra fittings to carry
//     the additional conductors.
//   • Panel board ×1.5 — three-phase load center and 3-pole breakers /
//     disconnects cost noticeably more than 1-/2-pole equivalents.
// Used in two places: (a) the bundled cablingTiersThreePhase default below,
// and (b) paramsService.js migration seeding for saved blobs that predate the
// key (derived from the LIVE single-phase tiers so the seed tracks any admin
// customizations). Engineering can override any 3-phase cell independently
// afterward via the Inventory tab.

// Bundled single-phase cabling tier defaults — declared outside ADMIN_PARAMS

// (single-phase) exactly. The Excel table is 8 rows; its VLOOKUP holds the
// 31-row rate for any count >31. The 62/103/155/206 rows below are app-only
// commercial tiers (finer resolution for large arrays) with no Excel
// equivalent — PRESERVED on re-seed rather than dropped, so >31-panel quotes
// keep their existing behavior. Drop these four rows for an exact 8-tier
// Excel mirror if commercial resolution is not wanted.
// v3-173 RE-SEED — transcribed from the LIVE parameter store (Pat, screenshot
// of the Engineering console). The bundled seed had drifted from what Anjon
// actually maintains in production, in three ways worth recording:
//
//   1. VALUE DRIFT in four rows. 8 (AC 16→15, board 23→24), 10 (DC 29→23,
//      AC 13→12), 13 (DC 29→31, board 17→13), 31 (conduits 20→21). Row 8's
//      total is unchanged at 125%; the others move the total.
//   2. THE COMMERCIAL TIERS (62 / 103 / 155 / 206) DO NOT EXIST IN PRODUCTION
//      and are dropped here. Above 31 panels the 31-panel row now applies flat,
//      which is exactly what the live store has always done.
//   3. That deletion removes the ONLY monotonicity violation in the table. The
//      old 62-panel row priced 25% against a 25.50% floor, so a 62-panel system
//      was quoted ₱133,274 LESS cabling than a 61-panel one. It was a seed-only
//      defect — production never had it, because production never had the row.
//
// MONOTONICITY: every row clears its floor (see the anchor rule below). Three
// rows sit within a point of it — 10p at 100.00% against a 100.00% floor (zero
// headroom), 19p at 71% against 70.74%, 24p at 57% against 56.21%. Anjon has
// been operating blind to that; the console now shows the floor per field.
//
// THE ANCHOR RULE: cabling costs pct × panels × panelPrice, so a tier's cost at
// its own minPanels is its ANCHOR. Non-decreasing cost across the ladder
// requires  pct[i] ≥ pct[i-1] × minPanels[i-1] / minPanels[i].

  // ─── Misc materials / labor / services catalog (v3-138) ────────────────────
  // Step 2F used to be six wholly free-form rows: the rep typed a description
  // AND a price, and the line carried `cogs: null` — no COGS basis, no margin
  // discipline, no way to know what any of it actually cost. This catalog is
  // Anjon's BOM Q3 list, maintained on the Engineering tab exactly like
  // deliveryLocations (add / delete / In-stock checkbox), so a rep picks from
  // priced standards instead of inventing numbers.
  //
  // `cogs` is PRE-VAT COST — the workbook's "Cost (VAT Exc)" column, same
  // basis as every other Anjon-entered figure. `price` is DERIVED per row in
  // deriveDirectPrices() at the QUOTE's capacity margin (battery-packages /
  // deliveryLocations pattern), which means the unit price a rep sees in 2F
  // moves with panel count — a ₱4,650 breaker bills at ₱7,825 on a 1 kWp job
  // and ₱8,943 at the 30% ceiling. That is the margin curve working as
  // specified (v3-92), not a bug; user-confirmed before build.
  //
  // COGS carries CENTAVOS here (four rows are ₱4,089.12), unlike the integer
  // COGS scalars elsewhere. directFromCogs() already CEILINGs to whole pesos,
  // so the derived price is unaffected — but rounding the INPUT would silently
  // drift Anjon's sheet, so the editor preserves 2dp.
  //
  // available:false keeps the row (and its price history) but drops it from
  // the 2F dropdown — v3-106 stock idiom. A live session holding a hidden or
  // deleted id prices at ZERO and shows an amber notice in 2F, mirroring
  // "availability never blocks the flow".
  // v3-150 — each row gains `category`: which of the three Quote Summary
  // groups its 2F line reports into ('solar' | 'battery' | 'misc'). Anjon sets
  // it per item on the Engineering tab. Every seeded row ships as 'misc' and a
  // row restored from a pre-v3-150 blob has no category at all, which also
  // reads as 'misc' — so nothing lands in the wrong group by accident, but the
  // live catalog DOES need a pass from Engineering after deploy (notably the
  // REVERSAL rows, which belong with the package they cancel).

  // batteries from different brands like BYD vs. another vendor).

//      labor are currently identical across packages and mathematically
//      cancel, but they're included deliberately (user direction) so the

// never fill), then fewer units, then earlier position in the admin list.
