// =============================================================================
// PAYOFF PANEL MODEL (v3-192)
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Shared by the desktop Step 3 graphic and the mobile screen-6 graphic.
//
// WHY THIS IS A MODULE AND NOT DUPLICATED IN THE TWO COMPONENTS.
// The panel makes a CLAIM ABOUT A SIGN — whether the monthly saving rises or
// falls — and that claim is wrong in the obvious formulation. It is NOT "is
// inflation zero"; it is the sign of (1 - degradation)(1 + inflation) - 1,
// which crosses at inflation = degradation/(1-degradation), i.e. 0.5025% at the
// standard 0.5% degradation. A first pass of the desktop panel shipped
// "0.25% outpaces panel ageing, so it climbs" — false, and caught only in
// mockup. Writing that test a second time for mobile is precisely how the two
// surfaces would come to disagree, so it is written once, here, and both
// surfaces render what this returns.
//
// The savings series is read from the ENGINE's own cash-flow rows, never
// re-derived. Re-implementing the AB9:AB37 recurrence would create a second
// definition of the savings curve, free to drift from the one the quote is
// priced on (the v3-181 M8 lesson: a copy of the model is not the model).
// =============================================================================

// Where the combined factor sits close enough to 1 that calling it a rise or a
// fall overstates what the customer will see. At 0.50% the saving moves
// ₱8,800 → ₱8,795 across 25 years; "steady" is the honest word.
const FLAT_BAND = 0.0005;

// The panels are warranted for 25 years. Horizons short of that understate the
// system's life; beyond it the later years are an estimate.
